# Talk Ideas:
CRB 17-Feb-2014

## When not to ruby
[repo](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/patterns-of-failure)

A talk about when you might choose a langauge other than ruby.


## Horse e-books-motron
[repo](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/horse-ebooks-talk)

A talk about using golang's concurrency primitives to build up a complex chat room application that includes AI.

## Developer Honypot
> Refactoring code that your devops wrote.

This talk would be more of a performance-art piece.  What I think is interesting here is that one simple text file can kill CMM productivity for an afternoon.  Does that translate to talk-form?

## It's your problem now.
> How to take ownership of someone else's code base.

This idea is half baked, but I was just thinking about what I do when looking at someone's code.

1. Open VIM and `:r !tree -f`
2. Start at the top level test and then walk down through the routes -> controllers -> models
3. Run ctags

I've see you dig right into the unit tests.  There might be something interesting here.

## How to do code review
Basically a summary of what we've been doing for Ryan/Zach/Dr. Ryan.  Would end up being a really similar talk to "It's your problem now".

## VIM Pro-tips.
If we do this one, I want to challenge the audience.  I bet we can promise them that every single person will learn something new.  Also we would need to find a way to make it engaging, even if you're not a true believer.  Perhaps we could make some kind of game out of it, or tell a story?

Vanilla VIM only.  No plugins.

I know not everyone uses VIM at CRB, so this would need to have a slight 'why you should use VIM' slant.  Just a touch.
